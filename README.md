# Tetris_With_CPP

I developed tetris on my own using windows library and C++

## Created by :
 Ghassen Jamoussi

## Usage 
Download the project and add the header/source to a Microsoft Visual Studio project . 

Hotkeys : 
 - 'Down arrow' to go down faster
 - 'Left /'Right arrow' to go left/right  
 - 'Space' bar to restart the game after losing


## Note
The resolution of the game depends on my laptop. So if the game is buggy on your side, you need to adjust the resolution inside the main c++ program.
